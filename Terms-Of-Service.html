  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, and using Polynote, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
      If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the app.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. License and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Polynote grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the app for
      personal, educational, or professional purposes. You may not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to derive the source code</li>
      <li>Use the app for illegal or unauthorized purposes</li>
      <li>Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works</li>
      <li>Remove or obscure any proprietary notices</li>
      <li>Share or redistribute the app or any of its components</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. User Content and Ownership</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of all content you create using Polynote, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio recordings</li>
      <li>Transcriptions generated from your recordings</li>
      <li>Auto-generated study materials (flashcards, quizzes, key terms)</li>
      <li>Folders and organizational structures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not claim ownership of your content. All recordings and transcripts are stored locally on
      your device. When you use AI study materials features, transcript text is processed through
      OpenAI's API to generate flashcards and quizzes. You are solely responsible for backing up your
      data and ensuring your use complies with all applicable laws.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Recording Consent and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for obtaining all necessary consents before recording:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain consent from all participants before recording any conversation, lecture, or meeting</li>
      <li>Comply with federal, state, and local recording laws (some jurisdictions require all-party consent)</li>
      <li>Respect copyright and intellectual property rights of recorded content</li>
      <li>Do not record in situations where recording is prohibited</li>
      <li>Use recordings ethically and respect privacy of others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Failure to obtain proper consent may result in legal liability. Polynote is not responsible for
      your use of the recording features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Google Services Integration</h2>
    <p>Polynote offers optional integration with Google services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Sign-In: Optional authentication (not required to use the app)</li>
      <li>Google Calendar: Optional scheduling and event creation (requires explicit consent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When using Google services, you agree to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can
      disconnect Google services at any time without losing locally stored data. All core features
      work fully offline without Google integration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. AI Processing and Third-Party APIs</h2>
    <p>Polynote uses third-party AI services to enhance your experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenAI Whisper: On-device speech-to-text transcription (no data sent to servers)</li>
      <li>OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: Cloud-based AI for generating study materials from transcript text</li>
      <li>Cloudflare Workers: Secure backend proxy for API requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you use AI study materials features, your transcript text is sent to OpenAI via our backend
      proxy. Audio files are never uploaded. Study materials are generated once and cached locally.
      You can configure your own OpenAI API key or disable AI features in Settings. Use of OpenAI
      services is subject to OpenAI's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Polynote and its contents, features, and functionality are owned by us, licensed to us, or
      otherwise used by permission, including app design, software code, algorithms, transcription,
      and study material generation features. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
    </p>

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend access to the app if you breach these terms. Locally stored data
      will remain on your device.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service are governed by applicable laws. If any provision is found unenforceable,
      the remaining provisions shall remain in effect.
    </p>
  </div>
